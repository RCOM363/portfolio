JavaScript (JS) runs on a **single thread**, processing code **sequentially**, one line at a time. Yet many real-world tasks like reading files, querying databases, or fetching data from a server take longer than simple tasks. If JS waited for each of these tasks to finish before moving on, web pages and servers would freeze.

For example, lets make an simple `GET` request to an API

```javascript
let response = fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
console.log("Todos: ", response);
```

The above code doesn't log the data because fetch which is a longer running task has not finished processing yet so it doesn't return an value immediately rather it returns a `Promise`.

# Promises

The `Promise` is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

You can think of it like lending money to a friend they "promise" to pay you back later. You don’t get the cash immediately, you wait until they fulfill (or break) that promise.

## Creating a Promise

A `Promise` object can be created using `Promise()` constructor, which takes an _executor_ function which receives two arguments `resolve` and `reject`. Calling `resolve(value)` marks the promise as **fulfilled** and sets its result to `value`, while calling `reject(reason)` marks it as **rejected** with the given `reason`.

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const success = Math.random() > 0.5;
  if (success) {
    resolve("Operation succeeded!");
  } else {
    reject("Operation failed!");
  }
});
```

A `Promise` object has three key components:

- **Promise State** :
  Represents the state of a `Promise`, has three states
  1. `pending` (initial)
  2. `fulfilled` (after `resolve`)
  3. `rejected` (after `reject`)
- **Promise Result** : The value passed to `resolve` or reason passed to `reject`
- **Promise Reactions** : The callback functions registered via `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` that run when the promise settles.

## Handling a Promise

Special chaining methods are used to handle `Promise` results, each accepting a callback.

- `.then(onFulfilled)` - runs when the promise is fulfilled
- `.catch(onRejected)` - runs when the promise is rejected
- `.finally(onSettled)` - runs after either outcome

```javascript
myPromise
  .then((value) => {
    console.log("Then:", value);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Catch:", error);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log("Finally: Cleanup or follow‑up tasks");
  });

console.log("This logs before the Promise settles.");
```

**Output**

```bash
This logs before the Promise settles.
Then: Operation succeeded!   // or Catch: Operation failed!
Finally: Cleanup or follow‑up tasks
```

Here, the `console.log()` outside the promise runs immediately, demonstrating that promises handle asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread.

# async/await

`async/await` offers a more readable, "synchronous" way to work with Promises. To use them first a function is marked as `async` and `await` is used before a `Promise` to pause until it settles.

Let's take the same `GET` API example

```javascript
async function getTodos() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
    console.log("Todo: ", response.json());
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Erros: ", error);
  }
}

getTodos();
console.log("This logs before the async function finishes.");
```

Here, `await fetch(...)` pauses inside `getTodo()` until the network call completes, so the `console.log()` in the next line also waits until the `Promise` is resolved. Errors bubble into the catch block.

# The JavaScript Runtime

Under the hood, JS engines (like V8 in Chrome or Node.js) use several components for async behavior.

![js-runtime-environment](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*AcLc2DIM6CX0fslWJ96BNQ.png)

1. **JS Engine** :
   - **Call Stack** : Executes one task at a time.
   - **Heap Memory** : Manages memory for object, variables and functions execution contexts.
2. **Web API** : Provides async features like `setTimeout`, HTTP requests, file I/O etc.
3. **Callback (Task) Queue** : Holds callbacks from APIs like `setTimeout`, DOM events etc.
4. **Microtask Queue** : Holds promise handlers (`.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`), results of `async/await` and micro task.
5. **Event Loop** :
   The event loop continuously watches the **Call Stack** and, whenever it’s empty, pulls in tasks from the queues. It always drains the **Microtask Queue** first running all its tasks in the stack before taking the next task from the **Callback Queue**.

Consider the below code snippet

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 100);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise then"));

console.log("End");
```

**Output**

```bash
Start
End
Promise then
Timeout callback
```

Let's understand how JS executes the above code step by step

1. Logs "Start".
2. Schedules a `setTimeout` to **Callback Queue**.
3. `Promise` object is immediately resolved and its `.then()` callback is added to **Microtask Queue**.
4. Logs "End".
5. **Call Stack** is empty, so event loop runs all tasks from **Microtask Queue** and logs "Promise then".
6. After **Microtask Queue** is empty, so event loop runs all tasks from **Callback Queue** and logs "Timeout callback".

**Note** : The delay passed to `setTimeout` is the delay before its callback is placed on the **Callback Queue** not a guaranteed wait before its execution.

# Conclusion

- JavaScript is single‑threaded but handles asynchronous work using Promises, `async/await`, and the event loop.
- Promises let you attach callbacks for success or failure without blocking the thread.
- `async/await` makes Promise‑based code read like synchronous code.
- The event loop coordinates tasks and microtasks to ensure non‑blocking, ordered execution.
